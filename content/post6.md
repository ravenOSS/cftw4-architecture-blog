This thoroughly uncoventional building was photographed by Pierre Ch√¢tel-Innocenti.

Designed and built over four decades ago in Portencia, Italy, the porthole fascia echoes the mass of the structure. Buttresses on either side visually anchor the drum to its site and counteracts the sense that it may roll away.

The residents of this standout mass comment upon the claustrophobic interior spaces, lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Alias animi omnis atque eius voluptas nisi id fuga, sit maxime! Nemo possimus quis dicta officiis dolores.
